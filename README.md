# CrossPolFuncFreq
The electric field of any antenna has two components, co-polarization and cross-polarization. This project is a study of the cross-polarization component of the electric field and its behaviour when the operating frequency is changed from the center frequency. One of the main application of this study is for the radio astronomy telescopes that require large reflector arrays to study the distant astronomical bodies. With increase in the human-made communication satellites, these arrays receive unwanted intereference with the signal of interest, creating corrupted data. In order to effectively operate these antennas, Electronically Reconfigurable Surface is implemented to cancel the pattern at the angle of interference. This method causes some change in the original pattern of co-polarization and cross-polarization component. This report is a study of the cross-polarization component in that case.

**Software used**

To generate the plots that appear in the report, MathWorks MATLAB is used. MATLAB is a programming and numeric computing software used to analyze data and design algorithms.
